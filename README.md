# StudentCoin--Cryptocurrency-price-prediction-
I worked on this as a part of thesis submission for my post graduation program. 
The studentcoin is a newly launced cryptocurrency and it's idea is integrating learning/education with blockchain and cryptocurrency.
I used the data from coinmarketcap.com and using R, applied the Geometric Brownian motion to the data and predicted the price after one month of the last value recorded.
